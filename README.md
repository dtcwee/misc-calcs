# Misc-Calcs (Miscellaneous Calculators)

Javascript financial calculators that used to be hosted on my ISP's free webspace.

But that got cancelled in July 2023, so I migrated them to Glitch in May.

If you need help calculating:
* The effect of borrowing on returns
* Whether you are 'wealthy'
* Superannuation salary sacrifice analyses
* How much unpaid overtime dilutes your wage
* The potential of timesheet embellishment
* Loan affordability
* Salary from contractor rate and vice versa

... then these calculators are for you.
