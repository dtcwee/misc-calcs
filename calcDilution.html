                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Time is money. Your money. You protect your money, but what about your time?
                    Using the calculator is fairly straightforward. Fill in the fields in the input
                    column and press 'calculate'.</p>
                <p>Working longer hours on a fixed salary not only reduces your quality of life,
                    it also lowers your rate of pay. Unpaid overtime can dilute your pay by a
                    significant amount. On the other hand, working less hours than your job
                    specifies - (which I do <i>not</i> advocate) - can potentially increase your
                    rate. Contrary to the stereotype of the Australian slacker, under-work doesn't
                    seem to be a problem these days.</p>
                <p>There is increasing pressure on workers to perform 'unpaid overtime'. I find
                    this disturbing. Free work should be free choice, not obligatory, and those who
                    offer their work without compensation should inform themselves about how much
                    they are selling themselves short.</p>
                <p>Similarly, I don't believe in grossly overstating your work hours. What you
                    gain in money and time, you lose in credibility. A happy medium between
                    over-work and under-work needs to be struck.</p>
                <p>Most jobs now require flexibility, so insisting on fixed hours is futile.
                    There needs to be a bit of give-and take. If overtime cannot be paid, perhaps a
                    'flexi' system could be used. Working longer than normal hours one week, could
                    mean working less than normal hours the next week.</p>
                <p>Don't know what normal working hours are? Thirty-seven and a half hours a
                    week. That's five days with half an hour lunch each day. It's why unions were
                    first organised. It's why May days and Labour days are celebrated. It's what our
                    forefathers fought for during the Industrial Revolution. And it's what unpaid
                    overtime threatens to unravel.</p>
                <p>To say that the 40-hour week has no relevance in today's environment is to
                    say that justice has no relevance in today's environment. Sadly, many of us
                    acquiesce to that view.</p>
